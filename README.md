# Volunteer-Activities
Getting USDSers involved in volunteer activities.

Here are a list of current ideas for volunteer activities:
1.	1 or 2 large-scale yearly initiatives either partnering with an existing organization or launching an initiative that is entirely USDS’ (think a worthwhile cause in-line with our ethos and culture).

2.	USDS Service day – all current and alumni USDSers, wherever they are will to partake in a giving-back-activity on this day

3.	Smaller quarterly time and money (collect funds for a cause, put together meals for the shelter, or volunteer time)

4.	Grassroots – post ideas on the #volunteering slack channel where small teams can form 
 
Specific examples: 
•	Leveraging our skills to mentor and coach young professionals on job search, career options, mock interviewing and so forth 
•	Purchase birthday packages to financially strapped families 
•	Put together bikes for foster kids 
•	Teach youth life skills 
•	Upwardly Global
•	Children’s hospital 
•	Organizations supporting the communities we serve for example veterans.

General Guidance:
From Kerry O’Dell, Laurie’s counterpart at OMB Ethics, See her response below.

To summarize:
• We can’t focus on only one organization to support
• Participation must be voluntary
• To post about it officially, we need approval
• Organizing something during business hours is a little tricky but doable as long as it’s a minimal amount of time.

All in all, sounds like we should be totally fine.

Kerry:
“From an ethics perspective, federal employees are required to remain impartial in the performance of their duties and not give “preferential treatment to any private organization or individual.” 5 C.F.R. § 2635.101(b)(8). To the extent USDS gives such time to one charitable organization, it must be prepared to give similar time to other charitable organizations. I caution USDS that employee participation should be voluntary – USDS might pick a nonprofit that offends some employees, and they should not be coerced into participating as a condition of their employment. Another idea: instead of USDS picking the charitable organization, there are some events that are organized by charitable organizations like the United Way’s Day of Caring. I’m not specifically endorsing the Day of Caring, just pointing out that there are events where someone else does the work of picking the nonprofits and matching them with local companies. USDS should ensure the nonprofit is not an association of persons who are prohibited sources, for example, the Alliance for Digital Innovation.

In order to use the USDS logo and broadcast the opportunity on social media, you will need approval from COMMS (DL.OMB.PressShop@omb.eop.gov).

Next, using business hours: if USDS is prepared to give official time as an agency to one nonprofit, it must be prepared to grant similar requests from other nonprofits, and USDS should not participate in these events so often as to impact the USDS mission. USDS can grant USDS employees administrative leave in order to participate in nonprofit activities. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) advises that administrative leave is not an entitlement, and USDS is not required to grant it. OPM advises agencies to limit administrative leave to situations not specifically prohibited by law and satisfying one or more of the following criteria: (1) the absence is directly related to the agency’s mission; (2) the absence is officially sponsored or sanctioned by the head of the department or agency; (3) the absence will clearly enhance the professional development or skills of the employee in his or her current position; or (4) the absence is as brief as possible under the circumstances and determined to be in the interest of the agency. Teambuilding is often given as a reason to satisfy #4 when the nonprofit activity is not directly related to the agency’s mission or will enhance the employee’s skills. OPM includes agency-approved volunteer activities as an example of appropriate use of administrative leave so long as the volunteer activity satisfies one of the four criteria. It is the responsibility of each agency head to balance support for employees’ volunteer activities with the need to ensure that employees’ work requirements are fulfilled and that agency operations are conducted efficiently and effectively. If USDS grants administrative leave to some employees to participate in nonprofit activities, it must be prepared to grant similar requests from others. To use USDS official time or grant employees administrative leave, USDS should determine (preferably in writing) that the activity is in the best interest of USDS.

There is one caveat about using administrative leave: no component may place an employee on administrative leave for more than 30 consecutive days without prior approval of the component head or his/her designee. If USDS has an employee on administrative leave for 30 consecutive days who requests an additional day of administrative leave to participate in one of these events, that request should not be granted without circling back to OGC.
